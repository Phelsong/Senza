# Senza

**Element Framework for PyScript**


## What is Senza?

senza is a lightweight wrapper/framework around the `pydom` api already offered with pyscript, with a few added features, namely:
    - Quick project bootstrapping
    - Type Annotations while developing
    - Composable Elements with Python native syntax (i.e. an easy method to create, remove, or modify any element)
    - a lightweight DOM router, for quickly building page navigation
